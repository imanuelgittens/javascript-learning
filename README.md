# javascript-learning
This repository will house all the practice coding I did on my road to JavaScript mastery

Update: June 21st 2015
It seems that a little bit of coding everyday is the best way to go when learning to code. I also try to push commits to github as much as possible. 
There is a gap in javascript knowledge that i'm currently trying to close i.e. I'm finished with the basics but now I have to get into Functional Programming, Inheritance and Array Methods. 

Update August 11th 2015
Anthony Alicea's JS weird parts course on UDEMY really opened up my eyes to some of the finer points of javascript. It taught me about functional programming and Inheritance and everything else! I'll be continuously practising coding and going back to his course for refinement. I am focusing on practise projects and FreeCodeCamp at the moment.

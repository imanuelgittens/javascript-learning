# javascript-learning
This repository will house all the practice coding I did on my road to JavaScript mastery

Update: June 21st 2015
It seems that a little bit of coding everyday is the best way to go when learning to code. I also try to push commits to github as much as possible. 
There is a gap in javascript knowledge that i'm currently trying to close i.e. I'm finished with the basics but now I have to get into Functional Programming, Inheritance and Array Methods.
